# Introduction

In this [mdbook](https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/), we will collect resources and tips for data scientists in bioinformatics.
It is meant as a quick reference for anybody, from someone getting started without any prior programming knowledge to experienced data scientists.
We initiated its development for a community of bioinformaticians at the DKTK site Essen DÃ¼sseldorf, but want to make this open for anybody from the wider local and global data science communities.
Contributions are very welcome, and can be anything from asking even the smallest question by [opening an issue](https://github.com/koesterlab/data-science-for-bioinfo/issues/new/choose), up to directly suggesting changes or additions via [pull requests](https://github.com/koesterlab/data-science-for-bioinfo/pulls).
The only thing to keep in mind is to keep this collection a welcoming place by following our [code of conduct](../CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
