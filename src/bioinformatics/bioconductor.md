# bioconductor

The [bioconductor website](https://www.bioconductor.org/) says it best:

> The mission of the Bioconductor project is to develop, support, and disseminate free open source software that facilitates rigorous and reproducible analysis of data from current and emerging biological assays. We are dedicated to building a diverse, collaborative, and welcoming community of developers and data scientists.
> 
> Bioconductor uses the R statistical programming language, and is open source and open development.

Thus, bioconductor provides standardized and reviewed bioinformatics packages, usually with good and extensive documentation.
All of its packages can for example be installed using `conda` via the [`bioconda` channel](bioconda.md).
