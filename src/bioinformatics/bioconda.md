# bioconda

> Bioconda lets you install thousands of software packages related to biomedical research using the conda package manager.

It has great usage documentation, so check out [how to get started using bioconda on its own website](https://bioconda.github.io/#usage).

The first step (also described and linked to on the website) is to install [conda](../command_line/conda.md), the package manager you need to use the bioconda channel.
Here, we recommend using the [mambaforge installation](https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge#install).

## conda basics


## contributing to bioconda

While you will nowadays find most bioinformatics packages on bioconda (and checking out a package on bioconda is a great way of checking how often it is downloaded), you will sometimes encounter packages that are not available there.
If you feel comfortable with installing such a tool manually, please consider contributing your solution to the channel in the form of a recipe.
There is a whole [documentation section dedicated to helping you contribute package recipes to bioconda](https://bioconda.github.io/contributor/index.html).
