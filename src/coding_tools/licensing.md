# Licensing

In general, you will have to check with your institution / employer if there are any requirements or limitations for releasing software and code that you develop.
This especially applies to licensing.

## Open Source licensing

To maximize possibilities of code re-use, which should be the default in research, Open Source licenses are the best choice.
For quickly deciding on an Open Source license for your project, use the interactive tool at [choosealicense.org](https://choosealicense.com/).
