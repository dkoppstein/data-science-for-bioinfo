# Markdown

Markdown is an plain-text syntax for writing structured texts that are both human-readable as plain-text and machine-readable for automatic parsing into different formats (HTML, PDF, ...).

For a standardized syntax definition, check out the [CommonMark project](https://commonmark.org/). They have a quick [Markdown syntax overview](https://commonmark.org/help/) that also links to a 10 minute tutorial.

Markdown is used extensively in many projects, e.g. for writing this [mdbook](https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/format/markdown.html) or for writing `README.md` files with [GitHub flavoured Markdown](https://github.github.com/gfm/#what-is-github-flavored-markdown-) on GitHub.
As it literally takes no more than 10 minutes to learn the basics and a couple of minutes to look up anything that is a bit more complicated (for example [tables in GitHub flavoured Markdown](https://github.github.com/gfm/#tables-extension-)), it is really worthwhile checking it out.
