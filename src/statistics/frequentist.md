# frequentist statistics

## learning statistical modeling

Susan Holmes and Wolfgang Huber have written the very comprehensive book [**Modern Statistics for Modern Biology**](https://www.huber.embl.de/msmb/), and you can read it all online for free.
Most importantly though, it has example R code and excercises to follow along.
Thus, if you want to learn all about frequentist statistics---with application in modern biology---this is the perfect resource.

## all the hypothesis tests

The [**Handbook of Biological Statistics**](http://www.biostathandbook.com/) by John H. McDonald has great explanations of all the statistical tests you could ever need in biomedical research.
And it has this [amazing tabular overview of all of the statistical tests](http://www.biostathandbook.com/testchoice.html), so you can easily choose the one you need for your data set at hand.

If you want to understand a bit more about how the theory behind a number of these tests is very similar (and thus not all too hard to actually understand), you can check out [**Common statistical tests are linear models**](https://lindeloev.github.io/tests-as-linear/) by Jonas Kristoffer Lindel√∏v.
The article has a great summary table and provides example code in R.
So it's also a great resource if you just want quick example code for running a particular statistical test in R.
