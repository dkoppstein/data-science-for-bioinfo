# Statistics

For a general understanding of **Probability, Mathematical Statistics, Stochastic Processes**, I often turn to [**Random** on randomservices.org](http://www.randomservices.org/random/index.html), a project by Kyle Siegrist.
It has great explanations and little apps to play around with certain processes and probability distributions.
Especially the [explanations of probability distributions](http://www.randomservices.org/random/dist/index.html) are very useful and often much better than what you can find on Wikipedia.
