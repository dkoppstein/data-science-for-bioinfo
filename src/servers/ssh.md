## ssh keys

ssh key files are a great way to set up safe ssh connections, and if properly set up with your operating system keychain, you can save on a lot of password typing.
There's a [great guide for generating and setting up ssh keys](https://www.ssh.com/academy/ssh/copy-id) that you can quickly work through step by step.
No need to remember any of this by heart, just look it up when you need it.
