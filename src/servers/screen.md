# persistent screen sessions

[`screen`](https://www.gnu.org/software/screen/manual/screen.html) is a tool that allows you to set up persistent `bash` sessions on a server (or another computer) that can continue to run when you log off / disconnect from them and that can have multiple windows (shell session) open at once.
Check out the [**Getting Started**](https://www.gnu.org/software/screen/manual/screen.html#Getting-Started) section of its online documentation.
